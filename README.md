1. Completing Achievements Clash of Clans has a set of achievements that reward players with gems upon completion. These achievements can range from upgrading your base to a specific level, donating troops to Clanmates, or participating in Clan Wars. Check the "Achievements" tab in the game to see which ones you can complete and claim free gems for.

2. Completing Events and Challenges Supercell often runs special events and challenges in Clash of Clans. These events can reward you with gems for completing specific objectives, such as attacking a certain number of bases or earning a particular amount of loot. Stay on the lookout for these limited-time events and complete them to earn free gems.

3. Clearing Obstacles In your base, you’ll often find obstacles like trees, rocks, and bushes. By clearing these, you can sometimes find gems. While the number of gems you get from obstacles is random, it’s still an easy way to accumulate a few extra gems over time. Make sure to regularly clear your base for hidden gems!

4. Clan Games and Clan War Leagues Participating in Clan Games and Clan War Leagues offers opportunities to win gems as rewards. By working together with your clanmates to complete Clan Games tasks or winning Clan War Leagues, you can earn free gems to help speed up your progress.
